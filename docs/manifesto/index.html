						<p>Gyris is more than an NFT project. What lies before you, an outline of perhaps the most ambitious experiment in collaborative creativity the world has ever seen. Gyris is ‘the first world of an endless gyre’; a multiverse that knows no
							bounds. If we are to agree that virtual worlds will become so real, they cannot be divorced from our own, we must also admit the possibility that our own world is itself a grand creation. Every reality conceived now and forever bound by
							one beautiful idea; that our imagination is God, and collectively, everything is possible.</p>

						<p>Gyris uniquely marries a deep narrative and world-class art with decentralized finance, governance and gaming. Gyris is trademarked and owned by Guerilla Development, a registered Australian Company. Our team believes that to truly
							give community assurances our plans will be realized, we need to display the highest order of transparency and legitimacy. This Litepaper Manifesto is a representation of early-stage costing and modeling that uses a minimum expected
							$USD take from the Genesis drop. Given the volatility of our market this is subject to change however we believe this is the best way to communicate intended action. In the case of slow sales, the founding team has committed to delivering upon the majority of what is laid out with their own funding but the metaverse and gaming play, that would require numerous additional hires might not be attainable. This is however a vision of what we can achieve together.

						<h2 id="story-gyris">STORY </h2>

						<h3 class="red" id="synopsis">Synopsis</h3>


						<p>Gyris is a three-part epic. Act 1: ‘The Sound of Trees Standing ‘ begins in the time of a Great War between the Minjierri and the Dharwar. A dark hand is at work. Heroes fall and others forged in pain. The beast-like Bura birth an
							unlikely hero. The fungus-cloaked Mara do the bidding of The Seed Gumurri. The Ochichurri threatens to break the shackles of the dark. All that is known is at stake; and in the unknown lies a truth larger than any could imagine.</p>



						<p>Follow Argus, Saras, Djalu and the inhabitants of Gyris in a saga spanning 3 generations. From the city of Porth, No one alone, can fight the Dark. </p>




						<h3 class="red" id="preamblic-history">Gyris: A Preamblic History (Prologue)</h3>



						<p>In the beginning times, Minjierri, Dharwar and Bura, a common line. Thought born of beasts, themselves formed through endless generations of change. They reach back to a great divide; a single spark of life, said made by the raining
							blood of the unseen Gods. Divided in two, all in part, eternal.</p>



						<p>The Crucible of life in Gyris was thought to be where the city of Porth now stands. The people of Porth, a coastal town, would marvel at the raging sea, and in the distance Alu Igwe, a mountain that shot up to the heavens. Some were
							drawn to it as a spiritual home; others sought the riches evident in the cracked earth; seams of coal and ore. As factions grew and tension mounted those that would protect Alu Igwe from plunder would later become the Dharwar. Those
							that would become the Minjierri wandered until they found Alu Igwe’s equal, Maka di Madu. They dug deep below the surface and over time the great mountain would diminish in size, no longer touching the heavens. The pillage of the
							surrounding lands resulted in the creation of a great desert. The Minjierri would move further and further underground.</p>



						<p>The Bura did not worship the sky, nor the underground. They would wander forever further into the reaches of Gyris, populating the remote and mountainous regions. </p>



						<p>From one tribe they became three, and from the three came many, spreading across Gyris. Eon after eon their features grew more dissimilar, easily distinguishable by the age in which we find our story. Though many of the Dharwar are
							farmers and masons, power now resides in the capital with the Cardigaristoi, a class of landowners that had replaced a previous feudal system. The Gharamur (Dharwar Shamans) maintain a connection to animals and the Earth that their
							brethren have all but forgotten. </p>



						<p>The Minjierri King Alavard, a loathsome glutton, grows tired of soil-ridden algae and scarce meat found at the mouths of his mines. Sending his soldiers out to fetch him the finest backstraps of the beasts that roam the borders of the
							world above, he begins to take far more than the little the world would tolerate. The beasts his soldiers left slain grow ever weary of the Minjierri, and slowly the beast clans began forming an alliance with the Dharwar brokered by the
							Gharamur Djalu.</p>



						<p>If not for the birds the Bura of Duara may have never entered the Great War. But then…..we wouldn’t have our story.</p>





						<h3 class="red" id="people-races-creatures">Peoples, Races and Creatures of Gyris</h3>



						<p>Gyris is coloured as richly as Earth with variation and difference. The Genesis drop will reveal four Genus of Gyris, the Peoples of the Bura, the Minjierri, Dharwar and the Mara.</p>




						<h4 class="red" id="bura">The Bura</h4>


						<p>Bura are a large beast-like species with considerable racial diversity as indicated by skin and hair colour. The Bura live largely remote and cut off from much of Gyris. Inspired by North Western Australia and Papua New Guinean
							geography we find dense forest, high mountains, deep cuts and valleys. Thunderous rivers but also endless branches of creek forks cutting lines in the mountainside. Families carve, paths into the earthen clay and form walkways from
							their hut to the waterways to wash and bath and fish.</p>



						<p>By day the Bura children play in the rock slides and rope swings. When they are old enough, they will spend their day looking for their Dua Tree. By night the Bura seek refuge in the citadels of the forest as the power of the Dua Tree
							wards off the creatures of the Dark (The Ochichurri). Though they vary in size the smallest adult Bura would reach 5 feet and the largest 8 feet. Each region each have their own ceremonial dress commonly worn by their classes and style
							of war paint for their warriors along with their social and cultural practices.</p>




						<h4 class="red">Bura Classes</h4>


						<p>Like with all beings, the Bura are not defined by one class but often find themselves with a predilection for a way of life or skillset that allows them greater success in a field. </p>


						<ul class="coloured">
							<li>Bu-Raa-Oo (Warrior): Forged when they can wield a Dua that makes itself known to them. Commonly seen in battle drenched in blood and war paint.</li>


							<li>Bu-Raa-Eh (Healer): Tend to have a greater affinity for other creatures and the ways of the forest. They say they can speak to the Mara while others see them like fairies, discounted as more myth or symbol of the power of Gumurri.
								They are apt at finding the herbs necessary to heal the sick and to those more powerful, that connect to The Seed. They are the artists and the storytellers. The Bu-Raa-Eh often where ceremonial head dresses.</li>


							<li>Garun (The Forest Lost): The Garun are mysterious Bura. When a Bura goes missing in the day they are thought to be dead or lost in the forest. If lucky enough to have found a Dua Tree, large enough to keep them safe from the
								Ochichurri, they stay in that tree making it their home. In these treehouses the Garun are known to grow quite insane and Bura children told to avoid if ever they come across one. Some Garun however have managed to make small
								strongholds deep into the mountains through the happenstance of two finding themselves close enough to offer greater protection. The Forest Lost have their own language independently formed from hearing the whispers of the wild. The
								Garun commonly have messy of patchy hair like mangy animals and are talked about in stories as having green hair like moss.</li>


							<li>Bu-Raa-See (Makers): The makers are adept at building all sorts of contraptions using natural materials. The most proficient makers tend to be from the Northlands where many Bura have Red rusty fur. They are engineers, builders,
								inventors of the natural form.</li>


						</ul>

						<h3 class="red" id="dharwar">The Dharwar</h3>

						<p>The Dharwar traditionally lived in grasslands and by the sea. They lived harmoniously with beast, only taking as much as was needed and as little to sustain the ecosystems from which they plucked but over time the Dharwar have evolved.
							Without the need for excessive physical labour, instead leaning on technology and innovation to enhance productivity, they only bear some resemblance to the Bura. Certainly not built for war, slenderer in face and build, bones moulded
							to suit their conditions. The Dharwar represent the old and the new in Gyris. Those who are connected to the seed and those who seek to quiet its voice through roads paved.</p>

						<h3 class="red">Dharwar Classes</h3>

						<ul class="coloured">
							<li>Cardagaristoi: The Dharwar replaced their feudal system with an aristocracy. Ruling families were known as part of the Cardagarastoi class and control much of the land of the Dharwar.</li>


							<li>The Vard (Masons and Architects): They are the most technical above ground builders in Gyris, able to erect grand scultures and structures. They make up are the Dharwar’s middle class.</li>


							<li>The Rash (Soldiers and Workers): The Dharwar rely more on weaponry and technology than brute strength. The Rash is where the Dharwar commonly place their intellectually challenged or poor. With only a small standing army, those who
								would work fields and construction would be conscripted into the army when deemed appropriate.</li>

							<li>The Gharamur (Shamans): A dying breed, once deeply respected now seen more like the bearers of witchcraft. The Gharamur lived largely hermetic lives, herding the grazing beasts and living on the plains. Over time the Gharamur had
								become so trusted that they had lived peacefully amongst the Bura, beasts and creatures of Gyris.</li>

						</ul>

						<h3 class="red" id="mara">The Mara</h3>

						<p>A mysterious Genus often taking form of funghi, plants or in the skins of small animals, insects and rodents. You will find their homes in trees and logs, made from parts of earth or sheltered under forest growth. The Mara have always
							been called to plant the Dua Tree atop stones Gumurri pushes through the earth. When the Mara witness the stones arise, they make gardens on top, regardless of its size, and plant the Duwa seed. Although small, their place in our saga
							could not be more important. They can transport themselves effectively via the mycelium network but this isn’t necessary given they connect to a hive mind. They can therefore just speak across it to another Mara anywhere the network
							reaches. In times where they must move another being (non-Mara) they may use the network as transportation.</p>

						<h3 class="red">Mara Classes</h3>

						<ul class="coloured">
							<li>Abali Mara (Eyes of the Night): They keep watch over the forest in the night. The Abali Mara came to be when the Dua Stones began to rise at night and darkness. This is the time in history when creatures of the dark began to rise.
							</li>


							<li>Duvali Mara (To Dance in Daylight): They make the gardens atop the Dua Stones in the day</li>


							<li>The Birds…….. </li>



						</ul>

						<h3 class="red" id="minjierri">The Minjierri:</h3>

						<p>The Minjierri occupy the underground. It is common to think of Peoples of the underground as dwarf-like, rotund and robust, but escaping the sun doesn’t do wonders for the health. The Minjierri stand between three and six-foot-tall.
							The harsh underground and lack of sunshine and appropriate diet mean the large majority of the Minjierri display signs of malnutrition and stunting. Their cities and strongholds are based strategically under mountains rich with
							resources, largely but not completely interlinked by mined arteries. They are thought to avoid the lands of the Bura given their hostility and proficiency for guerilla warfare. Whilst Mhorindoo is a stark example of the worst of the
							Minjierri, smaller tribes have been known to spend more time above ground, even living amongst the Bura and other species. These outposts tend to sever ties with any major arterial mines.</p>


						<h3 class="red">Minjierri Classes</h3>

						<ul class="coloured">
							<li>Jierri-Kin (Royal Blood): A lineage that traced back beyond memory and known for their interbreeding, their rotting teeth often replaced with gold and jewels. </li>


							<li>Parvos (Soldiers): Often blessed with the favour of the King, the King’s Army spent more time than any other class above ground. This left them with more colour in their skin, sharp intelligence and a dangerous knowledge of the
								world beyond the underground. They were also the most frequent to defect from Minjierri society.</li>


							<li>The Druge (Miners): Family lines of miners, lost some, if not all of their sight. Despite this, the physical labour made them strong and lean.</li>


							<li>Banished Infinitum: ‘Sentenced the fall’ for the most heinous of crimes, these poor souls were dropped down deep fissures in the earth’s core.</li>

						</ul>
						<h2 id="genesis">Genesis NFT Features </h2>
						<p>Each of the 10940 individual mints will produce an NFT with between 4-12 traits, randomly generated from approximately 500 traits. While there will be equal numbers of Bura, Minjierri, Mara and Dharwar the variation within each Genus
							will be immense, each provably unique. The team has conceptualized future airdrops so as to give holders the choice to combine with their genesis NFT’s or hold separately for sale or otherwise.</p>


						<p>Future expected utility for holders includes naming, map coordinates and backstory for their avatar alongside a myriad of interactions through defi and gaming revealed herein. Expected additional airdrops will be related to
							user-interaction with story, rewarding those who engage with immortality within story and lore.</p>


						<h2 id="roadmap-1">ROADMAP (STAGE 1)</h2>

						<p>Pre-Launch:<br>
							In the lead up to launch, narrative and art are periodically released.</p>

						<ul class="coloured">
							<li>Gyris - A Preamblic History: A prologue to the upcoming story release</li>

						</p>
						<br>


						<h2 id="world-of-our-making">A World of our Making</h3>

							<p>Our Genesis Drop aims to give life to the story of Gyris. Two separate but complimentary
								creative projects are within our roadmap with continuous interaction with community
								through our collaborative approach.</p>

							<h3 class="red" id="the-sound-of-trees">Gyris: The Sound of Trees Standing (A Pilot in the Golden-Age of Cinematic Television)</h3>

							<p>
There has never been a better time for volume of Television and Film Production and let’s be honest….a lot of garbage is getting made. We want to step well above that bar and produce the best pilot or ‘treatment’ our funding will allow. Established production houses fight for development funds for far less that what our sales will provide placing us in a amazing position to pitch our ideas to studios and streaming services.  Our writers have storyline for a minimum three films or seasons with a screenplay already complete. The screenplay will be released episodically, timed with airdrops in the months post-launch. Taking the storyline as inspiration our community will be invited to become ‘Official Gyris Artists’ and join our artists in developing the environments, characters and concept art. We will build the universe together.</p>


							<h3 id="the-game" class="red">Gyris Metaverse and Game</h3>


							<p>Genesis Holders will be our Gyris Metaverse Pioneers, dropped into the dawn of creation
								and given the rights to find their own corner of land to stake claim upon, terraform, build,
								create a community, and raise a family. Only Genesis Holders will become the First Peoples of their lands. All others will pay for the right to own. Imagine an opportunity to evolve the
								world of Gyris together with your community. A world where you don’t pay to play, but as
								was true in all emerging civilisations, you work to earn. In the Gyris game this will not only
								come in the form of ‘play-to-earn’ mechanics but uniquely through a ‘create-to-earn’
								philosophy.
								<br>
								Working together with the Gyris Gaming Division and the Creative Team, community artists
								will be engaged to display their art and depiction of Gyris in the ecosystem marketplace. If
								selected as ‘Official Gyris Game Assets’, the artist will take the lion’s share of the $GYRIS
								paid for its use in game. This serves the project and the artist. Non-artists can still
								contribute. Terraforming parts of Gyris will be tough and utilising the materials around you,
								you will be free to build your own patch in the metaverse. Any quality game is a multi-year
								project. We are here for the long haul. For more <a target="_blank" href="/metaverse">information</a>.
							</p>


							<br>

							<h2 id="collaborate-create-explore">Collaborate, Create, Explore!</h2>


							<p>Gyris will develop an ecosystem marketplace for community members to display their Gyris
								fan art. Not only is this a place for artists to be showcased to the community but the team
								will be allocating funds to purchase the rights to utilise the artist creations in the creative
								elements of the project listed below. Artists would maintain complete rights to negotiate
								their terms in keeping with our philosophy of cultivated creativity. We want your voice!
								Battle scenes, maps, character derivatives, voice overs for film and games, and through our
								DAO (read on), the direction of the multiverse itself! Together we will grow Gyris and give
								birth to new worlds.</p>


							<br>


							<h2 id="licensing-and-intellectual-property">Licensing, Intellectual Property</h2>


							<p>Each owner holds perpetual licensing and over their avatar, though intellectual property
								rights over the story elements of the world are retained by Guerilla Development and the
								Gyris team. IP is challenging because giving complete access to IP in a narrative-driven
								project would expose our community to theft by financial interests looking to capitalise on
								the richness of that narrative. We seek to drive and reward creativity from within thecommunity and reward those who create as well as those who recognise and support great
								art and projects. Your art will remain yours until you sell it to someone else at which time
								your relationship with your own IP is yours to decide.</p>
							<br>

							<h2 id="unique-model">A Unique Financial and Utility Model</h2>

							<p>This project will structure financing and secondary sales commissions, to incentivize ongoing
								commitment and enhance sustainability of the project.</p>

							<h3 class="red" id="initial-distribution-of-funds">Gyris Genesis Drop: Initial Distribution of Funds</h3>


							<p>Our founders only take their cut via salary for ongoing work, transparently, through a registered company, with financials shown to community each year.</p>



							<p>Studio Gyris (85%): Operational budget to deliver the film and gaming associated with the project. Paid to a registered Australian business who will deliver yearly audited financials for the community. Writers, artists, dev team will at this stage take a salary and financing will be repaid.</p>

							<p>Team (15%): Writers, artists, dev team, marketing, includes repaying financing.</p>

							<p>Treasury and DAO (7.5%): Used to fund community art competitions, set up the DAO, the $GYRIS token and liquidity pair.</p>

							<p>Charity partner (7.5%): Registered Papua New Guinean organisation Equal Playing Field will receive 7.5% of every sale. Our community supporting communities.</p>



							<h3 class="red" id="secondary-sales-commission">Secondary Sale Commission Distribution</h3>


							<p>Our view is that secondary sales should recognize ongoing commitments to the project. It is
								for this reason that the teams’ secondary commission will be held in the studio accounts
								and periodically released as both wages and dividends according to the success of the
								project. This removes the possibility of revenue share manipulation, where not all early
								members continue to push the project but still maintain revenue. For example, if a teammember wants to move off the project to work on other things, the work of that team
								member would need to be funded largely from the revenue share by which they attract.
								This arrangement is true for all team members with revenue share.</p>



							<h3 class="red">The project has attached an 6% secondary commission set out as the following;</h3>


							<p>Studio Gyris (80%) will receive 4.8% of every sale. This will encompass secondary for team who will derive salaries and dividend for ongoing work rather than ongoing commission if they choose to leave the team.</p>

							<p>Treasury/DAO (10%) will receive 0.6% of every sale</p>

							<p>Charity partner (10%) will receive 0.6% of every sale</p>

							<p>*assets sold on third-party marketplaces might incur an additional fee not payable to Gyris</p>

	<br>


							<h3 class="red" id="revenue-share">Revenue Share</h3>


							<p>The Gyris team will give back 50% of their profit generated from film, animations or the gamification of Gyris: The Sound of Trees Standing. The remaining 50% will be reinvested into the development of Studio Gyris for the betterment
								of the multiverse. After the end of the Australian financial year (June 30th), Guerilla Development Pty Ltd will present financials to the DAO along with a proposal for how we seek to reinvest those funds. The DAO will choose whether to
								accept
								the proposal or have the funds returned to them for their management.</p>



							<h3 class="red" id="gyris-token">$GYRIS Token</h3>


							<p>The $GYRIS token will be utilised within the Gyris ecosystem but will also feature as the base currency of the Gyris Multiverse. $GYRIS will have fit-for-purpose tokenomics where inflation will only occur when triggered by the
								formation of additional projects and universal DAO’s under the Gyris DAO (Gumurri) Network.</p>





							<h3 class="red">$GYRIS Token Distribution</h3>


							<p>$GYRIS is not a passive income play. Distribution of supply occurs through a holders community interactions. It has a floating supply cap, paralleling the distribution of NFT’s minted and owned by the multiverse community.<br>
Supply grows again when a new universe onboards new NFT owners, each holder can access episodic ecosystem rewards over the course of 24 months with a total circulating supply cap of 9,227,465 per Universe or DAO-approved project. 35% of each unlock will be available to holders, 30% for additional in-game rewards, 20% will go towards incentivizing liquidity providers and a further 15% will go to the DAO Treasury</p>

							<p>There is no pre-mined supply, no allocation for team other than relative to their NFT holdings and new supply is relative to the amount of token holders onboarded by new universes being born.</p>



							<h3 class="red" id="gyris-token-utility">$GYRIS Token Utility</h3>


							<p>Early utility will be for use in the Gyris marketplace. This marketplace will allow community members to buy and sell items depicting the universes and storylines of our multiverse using their $GYRIS. As new projects emerge their
								communities will also have access to these marketplaces. The $GYRIS token will also be used as the in-game currency.</p>

							<p>It is the team’s expectation that the Treasury tokens could be utilized for rewards in future gaming projects where $GYRIS can be utilized both to buy in-game assets and as play-to-earn mechanism but this would come at the discretion
								of the DAO and the community with choices including but not limited to, increasing incentivization structure for staking and LP, burning tokens and commissioning/buying community art.</p>



							<h3 class="red" id="staking">Staking</h3>


							<p>Staking will be used as unique blend of story-telling and economics. When preparing for battle, Gyris might call upon the troops to lock themselves into service to the Seed Gumurri, to fight against the dark, and to be rewarded with
								$GYRIS or airdrops.</p>



							<h3 class="red" id="exclusive-access">Access </h3>


							<p>Gyris Part II and Part III will grow the franchise and afford all genesis holders early access to the new projects. This means guaranteed presale access and exclusive perks.</p>



							<h3 class="red" id="communities-helping-communities">Community Helping Communities</h3>


							<p>10 years ago, ‘The Prophet’ (Adam) cofounded a charitable organisation in Papua New Guinea called Equal Playing Field. EPF has grown to become one of PNG’s most significant organisations working primarily in the prevention of
								violence
								against women and children. EPF has been vetted and funded by U.N agencies and governments around the world and produces yearly audited financials. Contributions from mint and secondary will fund EPF’s flailing office in Bougainville,
								an island still feeling the effects of civil war in the 1980’s and 90’s. Initial funded activities will be for digital libraries for remote communities that will allow communities to access much needed literacy, health, numeracy and
								vocational education. The Gyris community will become an unbelievable force for good in Bougainville and will be given regular updates from the EPF Team. 7.5% of mint and 10% of secondary commissions.</p>

							<h3 class="red">Gyris DAO (Gumurri) – 7.5% of sales</h3>


							<p>Finally, Gyris will gift the community the stewardship of the multiverse to which we belong. This will occur through the creation of a values-based DAO network. This revolutionary concept is like Stan Lee saying; “I want you to help
								govern the future of the Marvel Multiverse” to you after he wrote his first characters. This is that moment. The community will incubate ideas and seed them into the multiverse as part of a deep web of narrative. Each new project will
								feed back to its mother, the Gyris DAO for the grander development of the entire multiverse. Each new world will remain independent, it’s artists and new communities taking lead of its narrative.</p>

							<h2 id="gyris-dao">Gyris DAO (Gumurri)</h2>

							<h3 class="red" id="how-will-it-work">How Gyris DAO will work?</h3>


							<p>The Gyris DAO (Gumurri) is the first in a series of a values-based DAO developed in pursuit of true collaborative creativity, whilst honouring individual effort and intellectual property. Its purpose is to provide creative direction
								to
								the Multiverse. An experiment for all of us who say that greed and corporate interest stifles creativity by having financial gain as the only measure of success rather than a by-product of great art.</p>

							<p>The DAO does not own the IP of the GYRIS story but stewardship over the Gummuri Multiverse to which it belongs. Each new ‘universe’ or ‘reality’ will have its own relationship with its relevant community, DAO and intellectual
								property.
								Members of this community can put forward proposals consisting of a creative thesis and go to market strategy, for story forks and new projects that become part of the overarching Multiverse. This could manifest itself in a new
								Genesis
								Project with a new team that support them. These forks if seeking support from the Gyris and Gyris DAO Community would agree to a 5% of the project and DAO revenue contribution to the Gummuri DAO for the purposes of furthering the
								aims
								of the multiverse as a whole.</p>

							<p>These treasury funds can be used by Gummuri DAO for the development of games, series, art, etc using the moniker ‘Official Gummuri Content’ or under ‘Official Gyris content’ under arrangement with the IP holders (Founding team).
								These
								decisions using treasury funds will be able to utilize shared IP and engage in contracting relevant parties in their creation.</p>

							<img src="/img/gyris-dao-gumurri.png" alt="">

							<h3 class="red">Treasury Income</h3>


							<p>Immediately post sale the founding team will manage the Treasury with community support, until the DAO is initiated (as per roadmap) where it will be handed completely over to community governance. At this stage the DAO will receive
								any remaining treasury funds from sale and become the recipient of 7.5% of any Gyris: The Sound of Trees Standing, NFT sale’s commission.</p>

							<p>The DAO as an independent body may choose their own revenue generating activities including the growth of the multiverse.</p>



							<h3 class="red" id="responsibilities-of-the-dao">Responsibilities of the DAO</h3>


							<p>Curation: Allow members to vote on and officially endorse the introduction of new linked world/realities/universes</p>

							<p>Vetting and security: Assess the strengths of the project and project team</p>

							<p>Treasury management: Proposals and voting of the use of treasury funds</p>

							<p>Treasury Funds should be used for creative purposes though provisions will be in place that allow for investment instruments designed to maximizing profit, for use in creative endeavors that further the multiverse</p>

							<p>Creation: Trigger the minting of endorsed community projects and art from within the Gyris universe</p>

							<p>Remuneration: Increasing value of holding tokens by increasing value of the network and economic incentives from profits of projects funded by the DAO.</p>

							<p>Engagement: Shareholders are incentivized to get involved in creative pursuits and supporting the promotion of the multiverse.</p>

							<h3 class="red" id="dao-proposal">DAO Proposal for New Universe/World/Reality</h3>


							<p>Following our same model, a team of creatives decide to drop a new project, whether NFTs or not, and want to be part of the multi-verse. Perhaps some dialogue within the Gyris universe alludes to some “before place of the
								Rockmonsters”, and a community member conceptualises that world. By proposing their design thesis, and go-to-market strategy, the DAO can decide whether to seed this idea and accept the proposal from the founding team for support. It
								is
								up the proposing team to demonstrate why their fork belongs within the multiverse and how it is connected in some way. It must also demonstrate its commitment to the ideals of collaborative creativity and governance. Though each new
								project doesn’t need a DAO, a plan to display how they will integrate community into creativity is a crucial part of a Universe Proposal.</p>



							<h3 class="red">$GYRIS Token implications</h3>


							<p>The $GYRIS token total circulating supply cap is increased 9,227,465 per Universe or DAO-approved project.</p>
