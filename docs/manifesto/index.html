						<p>Gyris is more than an NFT project. What lies before you, an outline of
							perhaps the most ambitious experiment in collaborative creativity the
							world has ever seen. Gyris is ‘the first world of an endless gyre’; a
							multiverse that knows no bounds. If we are to agree that virtual worlds
							will become so real, they cannot be divorced from our own, we must also
							admit the possibility that our own world is itself a grand creation. Every
							reality conceived now and forever bound by one beautiful idea; that our
							imagination is God, and collectively, everything is possible.</p>

						<p>Gyris uniquely marries a deep narrative and world-class art with
							decentralized finance, governance and gaming. Gyris is trademarked and
							owned by Studio Gyris, under a registered Australian Company (Guerilla
							Development). Our team believes that to truly give community
							assurances that our plans will be realized, we need to display the highest
							order of transparency and legitimacy. This Litepaper Manifesto is a
							representation of early-stage costing and modeling that uses a minimum
							expected $USD take from the Genesis drop. Given the volatility of our
							market this is subject to change however we believe this is the best way
							to communicate intended action. In the case of slow sales, the founding
							team has committed to delivering upon the majority of what is laid out
							with their own funding but the metaverse and gaming play, that would
							require numerous additional hires might not be attainable in a reasonable
							timeframe. This is however a vision of what we can achieve together.
						</p>

						<h2 id="story-gyris">STORY </h2>

						<h3 class="red" id="synopsis">Synopsis</h3>

						<p>Gyris is a three-part epic beginning with ‘The Sound of Trees Standing ‘.</p>

						<p>As the gluttonous Minjierri slaughter the creatures of Gyris, the brave Bura
							come to their aid. While this great war ensues a reluctant hero rises.
							Aggy succumbs to the call of the Duali, the ancient tradition where Bura
							youth take a perilous quest in search of their fated ‘Dua’. These weapons
							are said to be divined by the gods themselves. But darkness seeks flesh
							beyond the battlefield and evil takes root in his dreams. If Aggy is to
							become the future of his people he must learn; that no one alone can fight
							the dark.
						</p>




						<h3 class="red" id="preamblic-history">Gyris: A Preamblic History (Prologue)</h3>



						<p>In the beginning times, Minjierri, Dharwar and Bura, a common line.
							Thought born of beasts, themselves formed through endless generations
							of change. They reach back to a great divide; a single spark of life, said
							made by the raining blood of the unseen Gods. Divided in two, all in part,
							eternal.</p>



						<p>The Crucible of life in Gyris was thought to be where the city of Porth now
							stands. The people of Porth, a coastal town, would marvel at the raging
							sea, and in the distance Alu Igwe, a mountain that shot up to the heavens.
							Some were drawn to it as a spiritual home; others sought the riches
							evident in the cracked earth; seams of coal and ore. As factions grew and
							tension mounted those that would protect Alu Igwe from plunder would
							later become the Dharwar. Those that would become the Minjierriwandered until they found Alu
							Igwe’s equal, Maka di Madu. They dug deep
							below the surface and over time the great mountain would diminish in
							size, no longer touching the heavens. The pillage of the surrounding lands
							resulted in the creation of a great desert. The Minjierri would move further
							and further underground.</p>



						<p>The Bura did not worship the sky, nor the underground. They would
							wander forever further into the reaches of Gyris, populating the remote
							and mountainous regions.</p>



						<p>From one tribe they became three, and from the three came many,
							spreading across Gyris. Eon after eon their features grew more dissimilar,
							easily distinguishable by the age in which we find our story. Though many
							of the Dharwar are farmers and masons, power now resides in the capital
							with the Cardigaristoi, a class of landowners that had replaced a previous
							feudal system. The Gharamur (Dharwar Shamans) maintain a connection
							to animals and the Earth that their brethren have all but forgotten.</p>



						<p>The Minjierri King Alavard, a loathsome glutton, grows tired of soil-ridden
							algae and scarce meat found at the mouths of his mines. Sending his
							soldiers out to fetch him the finest backstraps of the beasts that roam the
							borders of the world above, he begins to take far more than the little the
							world would tolerate. The beasts his soldiers left slain grow ever weary of
							the Minjierri, and slowly the beast clans began forming an alliance with
							the Dharwar brokered by the Gharamur Djalu.</p>



						<p>If not for the birds the Bura of Duara may have never entered the Great
							War. But then… we wouldn’t have our story.</p>





						<h3 class="red" id="people-races-creatures">Peoples, Races and Creatures of Gyris</h3>



						<p>Gyris is coloured as richly as Earth with variation and difference. The
							Genesis drop will reveal four Genus of Gyris, the Peoples of the Bura, the
							Minjierri, Dharwar and the Mara.</p>




						<h4 class="red" id="bura">The Bura</h4>


						<p>Bura are a large beast-like species with considerable racial diversity as
							indicated by skin and hair colour. The Bura live largely remote and cut off
							from much of Gyris. Inspired by North Western Australia and Papua New
							Guinean geography we find dense forest, high mountains, deep cuts and
							valleys. Thunderous rivers but also endless branches of creek forks cutting
							lines in the mountainside. Families carve, paths into the earthen clay and
							form walkways from their hut to the waterways to wash and bath and fish.</p>



						<p>By day the Bura children play in the rock slides and rope swings. When
							they are old enough, they will spend their day looking for their Tua Tree.
							By night the Bura seek refuge in the citadels of the forest as the power of
							the Tua Tree wards off the creatures of the Dark (The Ochichurri). Though
							they vary in size the smallest adult Bura would reach 5 feet and the
							largest 8 feet. Each region each have their own ceremonial dress
							commonly worn by their classes and style of war paint for their warriors
							along with their social and cultural practices.</p>




						<h4 class="red">Bura Classes</h4>


						<p>Like with all beings, the Bura are not defined by one class but often find
							themselves with a predilection for a way of life or skillset that allows them
							greater success in a field.</p>


						<ul class="coloured">
							<li>Bu-Raa-Oo (Warrior): Forged when they can wield a Tua that makes itself known to them.
								Commonly seen in battle drenched in blood and war paint.</li>


							<li>Bu-Raa-Eh (Healer): Tend to have a greater affinity for other
								creatures and the ways of the forest. They say they can speak to the
								Mara while others see them like fairies, discounted as more myth or
								symbol of the power of Gumurri. They are apt at finding the herbs
								necessary to heal the sick and to those more powerful, that connect
								to The Seed. They wield the Tua Staff.</li>

							<li>Bu-Raa-Murri (Hunter): ‘ Murri’ refers to the endless cycle of life.
								Bu-Raa-Murri tend to have a greater affinity for the many races of
								beast and the ways of the forest. They are expert hunters. They
								wield the Tua Spear</li>

							<li>Bu-Raa-See (Makers): The makers are adept at building all sorts
								of contraptions using natural materials. The most proficient makers
								tend to be from the Northlands where many Bura have Red rusty
								fur. They are engineers, builders, inventors of the natural form. The
								wield the Tua Hammer.</li>

							<li>Garun (The Forest Lost): The Garun are mysterious Bura. When
								a Bura goes missing in the day they are thought to be dead or lost
								in the forest. If lucky enough to have found a Tua Tree, large
								enough to keep them safe from the Ochichurri, they stay in that tree
								making it their home. In these treehouses the Garun are known to
								grow quite insane and Bura children told to avoid if ever they come
								across one. Some Garun however have managed to make small
								strongholds deep into the mountains through the happenstance of
								two finding themselves close enough to offer greater protection. The
								Forest Lost have their own language independently formed from
								hearing the whispers of the wild. The Garun commonly have messy
								of patchy hair like mangy animals and are talked about in stories as
								having green hair like moss.</li>

							<li>Chiefs and Master Chiefs: The Bura most often govern by a council
								of Chiefs (containing a Buraman and Burameri representative ofeach class) each of the
								major strongholds also names a Master
								Chief. They hold the deciding vote if one is necessary. They are not
								chose from any particular class rather for their ability to lead.</li>



						</ul>

						<h3 class="red" id="dharwar">The Dharwar</h3>

						<p>The Dharwar traditionally lived in grasslands and by the sea. They lived
							harmoniously with beast, only taking as much as was needed and as little
							to sustain the ecosystems from which they plucked but over time the
							Dharwar have evolved. Without the need for excessive physical labour,
							instead leaning on technology and innovation to enhance productivity,
							they only bear some resemblance to the Bura. Certainly not built for war,
							slenderer in face and build, bones moulded to suit their conditions. The
							Dharwar represent the old and the new in Gyris. Those who are connected
							to the seed and those who seek to quiet its voice under roads paved.</p>

						<h3 class="red">Dharwar Classes</h3>

						<ul class="coloured">
							<li>The Rash (Soldiers and Workers): The Dharwar rely more on
								weaponry and technology than brute strength. The Rash is where
								the Dharwar commonly place their intellectually challenged or poor.
								With only a small standing army, those who would work fields and
								construction would be conscripted into the army when deemed
								appropriate.</li>


							<li>The Gharamur (Shamans): A dying breed, once deeply
								respected now seen more like the bearers of witchcraft. The
								Gharamur lived largely hermetic lives, herding the grazing beasts
								and living on the plains. Over time the Gharamur had become so
								trusted that they had lived peacefully amongst the Bura, beasts and
								creatures of Gyris.</li>


							<li>The Vard (Masons and Architects): They are the most technical
								above ground builders in Gyris, able to erect grand scultures and
								structures. They make up are the Dharwar’s middle class.</li>

							<li>The Arthoulem (Religious Order): The Arthoulem began as a
								counter to the largely unstructured teachings of the Gharamur.
								Their rise to power was in many ways in tandem with theCardigaristoi. They seek to
								spread the word of Raányana, as told by
								the Dairrk um Burratu (Prophets of the Order).</li>

							<li>The Cardagaristoi: The Dharwar replaced their feudal system
								with an aristocracy. Ruling families were known as part of the
								Cardagarastoi class and control much of the land of the Dharwar.</li>

						</ul>

						<h3 class="red" id="mara">The Mara</h3>

						<p>A mysterious Genus often taking form of funghi, plants or in the skins of
							small animals, insects and rodents. You will find their homes in trees and
							logs, made from parts of earth or sheltered under forest growth. The Mara
							have always been called to plant the Tua Tree atop stones Gumurri
							pushes through the earth. When the Mara witness the stones arise, they
							make gardens on top, regardless of its size, and plant the Duwa seed.
							Although small, their place in our saga could not be more important. They
							can transport themselves effectively via the mycelium network but this
							isn’t necessary given they connect to a hive mind. They can therefore just
							speak across it to another Mara anywhere the network reaches. In times
							where they must move another being (non-Mara) they may use the
							network as transportation.</p>

						<h3 class="red">Mara Classes</h3>

						<ul class="coloured">
							<li>Abali Mara (Eyes of the Night): They keep watch over the forest
								in the night. The Abali Mara came to be when the Tua Stones began
								to rise at night and darkness. This is the time in history when
								creatures of the dark began to rise.
							</li>


							<li>Duvali Mara (To Dance in Daylight): They make the gardens
								atop the Tua Stones in the day.</li>


							<li>Iguela de Wara: Mara of the water</li>

							<li>Mara Anya: Mara that exist between this world and the next</li>

							<li><strong>The birds...</strong></li>


						</ul>

						<h3 class="red" id="minjierri">The Minjierri:</h3>

						<p>The Minjierri occupy the underground. It is common to think of Peoples of
							the underground as dwarf-like, rotund and robust, but escaping the sun
							doesn’t do wonders for the health. The Minjierri stand between three and
							six-foot-tall. The harsh underground and lack of sunshine and appropriate
							diet mean the large majority of the Minjierri display signs of malnutrition
							and stunting. Their cities and strongholds are based strategically under
							mountains rich with resources, largely but not completely interlinked by
							mined arteries. They are thought to avoid the lands of the Bura given their
							hostility and proficiency for guerilla warfare. Whilst Mhorindoo is a stark
							example of the worst of the Minjierri, smaller tribes have been known to
							spend more time above ground, even living amongst the Bura and other
							species. These outposts tend to sever ties with any major arterial mines.</p>


						<h3 class="red">Minjierri Classes</h3>

						<ul class="coloured">
							<li>Jierri-Kin (Royal Blood): A lineage that traced back beyond memory
								and known for their interbreeding, their rotting teeth often replaced with
								gold and jewels.</li>


							<li>Parvos (Soldiers): Often blessed with the favour of the King, the King’s
								Army spent more time than any other class above ground. This left them
								with more colour in their skin, sharp intelligence and a dangerous
								knowledge of the world beyond the underground. They were also the most
								frequent to defect from Minjierri society.</li>


							<li>The Druge (Miners): Family lines of miners, lost some, if not all of their
								sight. Despite this, the physical labour made them strong and lean.</li>


							<li>Banished Infinitum: ‘Sentenced the fall’ for the most heinous of crimes,
								these poor souls were dropped down deep fissures in the earth’s core.</li>

						</ul>
						<h2 id="genesis">Genesis NFT Features </h2>
						<p>Each of the 10940 individual mints will produce an NFT with between 8-13
							traits, randomly generated from approximately 7500 traits making our
							collection one of the most varied collections anywhere. While there will be
							equal numbers of Bura, Minjierri, Mara and Dharwar the variation within
							each Genus will be immense, each provably unique. The team has
							conceptualized future airdrops so as to be truly complimentary and
							aligned with storyline.</p>


						<p>Future expected utility for holders includes naming, map coordinates and
							backstory for their avatar alongside a myriad of interactions through defi
							and gaming revealed herein. Expected additional airdrops will be related
							to user-interaction with story, rewarding those who engage with
							immortality within story and lore.</p>

						</ul>



						<h2 id="world-of-our-making">A World of our Making</h3>

							<p>Our Genesis Drop aims to give life to the story of Gyris. Two separate but
								complimentary creative projects are within our roadmap with continuous
								interaction with community through our collaborative approach.</p>
							<h3>Film, Gaming, Metaverse….isn’t that a little ambitious?</h3>

							<p>We hear this a lot, and in any other time in history you might say that our
								ambition would be our downfall. However, in this time, ‘our time’ we find a
								unique confluence of technology and culture. We are commencing our
								build on Unreal Engine 5 and this amazing technology is being used more
								and more by the very best filmmakers and game developers. This means
								that when we are building our environments and playable characters in
								UE5 they are useable for our efforts in both game and film. So where
								some people see a split in the investment and energy of the team, we see
								a doubling of investment opportunity from two separate sectors.</p>

							<h3>Gyris: The Sound of Trees Standing (Screenplay)</h3>

							<p>There has never been a better time for volume of Television and Film
								Production and let’s be honest….a lot of garbage is getting made. We
								want to step well above that bar and produce the best pilot or ‘treatment’
								our funding will allow. Established production houses fight for
								development funds for far less that what our sales will provide. This places
								us in an amazing position to pitch our ideas to studios and streaming
								services. Our writers have storyline for a minimum three films or seasons
								with a screenplay already complete. The screenplay will be released
								episodically, timed with airdrops in the months post-launch. Taking the
								storyline as inspiration our community will be invited to become ‘Official
								Gyris Artists’ and join our artists in developing the environments,
								characters and concept art. We will build the universe together and this
								will form part of the appeal to investors.</p>

							<h3>Gyris Metaverse and Game</h3>

							<p>Genesis Holders will be our Gyris Metaverse Pioneers, dropped into the
								dawn of creation and given the rights to find their own corner of land to
								stake claim upon, terraform, build, create a community, and raise a
								family. Only Genesis Holders will become the First Peoples of their lands.
								All others will pay for the right to own. Imagine an opportunity to evolve
								the world of Gyris together with your community. A world where you don’t
								pay to play, but as was true in all emerging civilisations, you work to earn.
								In the Gyris game this will not only come in the form of ‘play-to-earn’
								mechanics but uniquely through a ‘create-to-earn’ philosophy.</p>

							<p>Working together with the Gyris Gaming Division and the Creative Team,
								community artists will be engaged to display their art and depiction of
								Gyris in the ecosystem marketplace. If selected as ‘Official Gyris Game
								Assets’, the artist will take the lion’s share of the $GYRIS paid for its use in
								game. This serves the project and the artist. Non-artists can still
								contribute. Terraforming parts of Gyris will be tough and utilising the
								materials around you, you will be free to build your own patch in themetaverse. Any
								quality game is a multi-year project. We are here for the
								long haul. For more <a target="_blank" href="/gaming">information</a>.</p>



							<h2 id="collaborate-create-explore">Collaborate, Create, Explore!</h2>


							<p>Gyris will develop an ecosystem marketplace for community members to
								display their Gyris fan art. Not only is this a place for artists to be
								showcased to the community but the team will be allocating funds to
								purchase the rights to utilise the artist creations in the creative elements
								of the project listed below. Artists would maintain complete rights to
								negotiate their terms in keeping with our philosophy of cultivated
								creativity. We want your voice! Battle scenes, maps, character
								derivatives, voice overs for film and games, and through our DAO (read
								on), the direction of the multiverse itself! Together we will grow Gyris and
								give birth to new worlds.</p>


							<br>


							<h2 id="licensing-and-intellectual-property">Licensing, Intellectual Property</h2>


							<p>Each owner holds perpetual licensing and over their avatar, though
								intellectual property rights over the story elements of the world are
								retained by Studio Gyris. IP is challenging because giving complete access
								to IP in a narrative-driven project would expose our community to theft by
								financial interests looking to capitalise on the richness of that narrative.
								We seek to drive and reward creativity from within the community and
								reward those who create as well as those who recognise and support
								great art and projects. Your art will remain yours until you sell it to
								someone else at which time your relationship with your own IP is yours to
								decide.</p>
							<br>

							<h2 id="unique-model">A Unique Financial and Utility Model</h2>

							<p>This project will structure financing and secondary sales commissions, to
								incentivize ongoing commitment and enhance sustainability of the
								project.</p>

							<h3 class="red" id="initial-distribution-of-funds">Gyris Genesis Drop: Initial Distribution
								of Funds</h3>


							<p>Our founders only take their cut via salary for ongoing work,
								transparently, through a registered company, with financials shown to
								community each year.</p>



							<p><strong>Studio Gyris (85%):</strong> Operational budget to deliver the film and gaming
								associated with the project. Paid to a registered Australian business who
								will deliver yearly audited financials for the community. Writers, artists,
								dev team will at this stage take a salary and financing will be repaid.</p>

							<p><strong>Treasury and DAO (7.5%):</strong> Used to fund community art competitions,
								set up the DAO, the $GYRIS token and liquidity pair.</p>

							<p><strong>Charity partner</strong> (7.5%): Registered Papua New Guinean organisation
								Equal Playing Field will receive 7.5% of every sale. Our community
								supporting communities.</p>



							<h3 class="red" id="secondary-sales-commission">Secondary Sale Commission Distribution</h3>


							<p>Our view is that secondary sales should recognize ongoing commitments
								to the project. It is for this reason that the teams’ secondary commission
								will be held in the studio accounts and periodically released as both wages
								and dividends according to the success of the project. This removes the
								possibility of revenue share manipulation, where not all early members
								continue to push the project but still maintain revenue. For example, if a
								team member wants to move off the project to work on other things, the
								work of that team member would need to be funded largely from the
								revenue share by which they attract. This arrangement is true for all teammembers with
								revenue share.</p>



							<h3 class="red">The project has attached an 6% secondary commission set out as the
								following;</h3>


							<p><strong>Studio Gyris (80%)</strong> will receive 4.8% of every sale. This will encompass
								secondary for team who will derive salaries and dividend for ongoing work
								rather than ongoing commission if they choose to leave the team.</p>

							<p><strong>Treasury/DAO (10%)</strong> will receive 0.6% of every sale</p>

							<p><strong>Charity partner (10%)</strong> will receive 0.6% of every sale</p>

							<p>*assets sold on marketplaces incur an additional 2.5-3% fee not payable
								to Gyris but when the Gyris marketplace is active the default fee will be
								0% but the DAO may choose to apply a small fee to go straight to
								treasury. Team will take no additional fees from internal marketplace</p>




							<h3 class="red" id="revenue-share">Revenue Share</h3>


							<p>The Gyris team will give back 50% of their profit generated from film, animations or the
								gamification of Gyris: The Sound of Trees Standing. The remaining 50% will be reinvested
								into the development of Studio Gyris for the betterment
								of the multiverse. After the end of the Australian financial year (June 30th), Guerilla
								Development Pty Ltd will present financials to the DAO along with a proposal for how we
								seek to reinvest those funds. The DAO will choose whether to
								accept
								the proposal or have the funds returned to them for their management.</p>



							<h3 class="red" id="gyris-token">$GYRIS Token</h3>


							<p>The $GYRIS token will be utilised within the Gyris ecosystem but will also
								feature as the base currency of the Gyris Multiverse. $GYRIS will have fit-
								for-purpose tokenomics where inflation will only occur when triggered by
								the formation of additional projects and universal DAO’s under the Gyris
								DAO (Gumurri) Network.</p>





							<h3 class="red">$GYRIS Token Distribution</h3>


							<p>$GYRIS is not a passive income play. Distribution of supply occurs through
								a holders community interactions. It has a floating supply cap, paralleling
								the distribution of NFT’s minted and owned by the multiverse community.
								Supply grows again when a new universe onboards new NFT owners, each
								holder can access episodic ecosystem rewards over the course of 24
								months with a total circulating supply cap of 9,227,465 per Universe or
								DAO-approved project. 35% of each unlock will be available to holders,
								30% for additional in-game rewards, 20% will go towards incentivizing
								liquidity providers and a further 15% will go to the DAO Treasury.</p>

							<p>There is no pre-mined supply, no allocation for team other than relative to
								their NFT holdings and new supply is relative to the amount of token
								holders onboarded by new universes being born.</p>



							<h3 class="red" id="gyris-token-utility">$GYRIS Token Utility</h3>


							<p>Early utility will be for use in the Gyris marketplace. This marketplace will
								allow community members to buy and sell items depicting the universes
								and storylines of our multiverse using their $GYRIS. As new projects
								emerge their communities will also have access to these marketplaces.
								The $GYRIS token will also be used as the in-game currency.</p>

							<p>It is the team’s expectation that the Treasury tokens could be utilized for
								rewards in future gaming projects where $GYRIS can be utilized both to
								buy in-game assets and as play-to-earn mechanism but this would come
								at the discretion of the DAO and the community with choices including but
								not limited to, increasing incentivization structure for staking and LP,
								burning tokens and commissioning/buying community art.</p>



							<h3 class="red" id="staking">Staking</h3>


							<p>Staking will be used as unique blend of story-telling and economics. When
								preparing for battle, Gyris might call upon the troops to lock themselves
								into service to the Seed Gumurri, to fight against the dark, and to be
								rewarded with $GYRIS or airdrops.</p>



							<h3 class="red" id="exclusive-access">Access </h3>


							<p>Gyris Part II and Part III will grow the franchise and afford all genesis
								holders early access to the new projects. This means guaranteed presale
								access and exclusive perks.</p>



							<h3 class="red" id="communities-helping-communities">Community Helping Communities</h3>


							<p>10 years ago, ‘The Prophet’ (Adam) cofounded a charitable organisation in
								Papua New Guinea called Equal Playing Field. EPF has grown to become
								one of PNG’s most significant organisations working primarily in the
								prevention of violence against women and children. EPF has been vetted
								and funded by U.N agencies and governments around the world and
								produces yearly audited financials. Contributions from mint and secondary
								will fund EPF’s flailing office in Bougainville, an island still feeling the
								effects of civil war in the 1980’s and 90’s. Initial funded activities will be
								for digital libraries for remote communities that will allow communities to
								access much needed literacy, health, numeracy and vocational education.
								The Gyris community will become an unbelievable force for good in
								Bougainville and will be given regular updates from the EPF Team. 7.5% of
								mint and 10% of secondary commissions.</p>

							<h3 class="red">Gyris DAO (Gumurri) – 7.5% of sales</h3>


							<p>Finally, Gyris will gift the community the stewardship of the multiverse to
								which we belong. This will occur through the creation of a values-based
								DAO network. This revolutionary concept is like Stan Lee saying; “I want
								you to help govern the future of the Marvel Multiverse” to you after he
								wrote his first characters. This is that moment. The community will
								incubate ideas and seed them into the multiverse as part of a deep web of
								narrative. Each new project will feed back to its mother, the Gyris DAO for
								the grander development of the entire multiverse. Each new world will
								remain independent, it’s artists and new communities taking lead of its
								narrative.</p>

							<h2 id="gyris-dao">Gyris DAO (Gumurri)</h2>

							<h3 class="red" id="how-will-it-work">How Gyris DAO will work?</h3>


							<p>The Gyris DAO (Gumurri) is the first in a series of a values-based DAO developed in
								pursuit of true collaborative creativity, whilst honouring individual effort and
								intellectual property. Its purpose is to provide creative direction
								to
								the Multiverse. An experiment for all of us who say that greed and corporate interest
								stifles creativity by having financial gain as the only measure of success rather than a
								by-product of great art.</p>

							<p>The DAO does not own the IP of the GYRIS story but stewardship over the Gummuri
								Multiverse to which it belongs. Each new ‘universe’ or ‘reality’ will have its own
								relationship with its relevant community, DAO and intellectual
								property.
								Members of this community can put forward proposals consisting of a creative thesis and
								go to market strategy, for story forks and new projects that become part of the
								overarching Multiverse. This could manifest itself in a new
								Genesis
								Project with a new team that support them. These forks if seeking support from the Gyris
								and Gyris DAO Community would agree to a 5% of the project and DAO revenue contribution
								to the Gummuri DAO for the purposes of furthering the
								aims
								of the multiverse as a whole.</p>

							<p>These treasury funds can be used by Gummuri DAO for the development of games, series,
								art, etc using the moniker ‘Official Gummuri Content’ or under ‘Official Gyris content’
								under arrangement with the IP holders (Founding team).
								These
								decisions using treasury funds will be able to utilize shared IP and engage in
								contracting relevant parties in their creation.</p>

							<img src="/img/gyris-dao-gumurri.png" alt="">

							<h3 class="red">Treasury Income</h3>


							<p>Immediately post sale the founding team will manage the Treasury with community support,
								until the DAO is initiated (as per roadmap) where it will be handed completely over to
								community governance. At this stage the DAO will receive
								any remaining treasury funds from sale and become the recipient of 7.5% of any Gyris:
								The Sound of Trees Standing, NFT sale’s commission.</p>

							<p>The DAO as an independent body may choose their own revenue generating activities
								including the growth of the multiverse.</p>



							<h3 class="red" id="responsibilities-of-the-dao">Responsibilities of the DAO</h3>


							<p>Curation: Allow members to vote on and officially endorse the introduction of new linked
								world/realities/universes</p>

							<p>Vetting and security: Assess the strengths of the project and project team</p>

							<p>Treasury management: Proposals and voting of the use of treasury funds</p>

							<p>Treasury Funds should be used for creative purposes though provisions will be in place
								that allow for investment instruments designed to maximizing profit, for use in creative
								endeavors that further the multiverse</p>

							<p>Creation: Trigger the minting of endorsed community projects and art from within the
								Gyris universe</p>

							<p>Remuneration: Increasing value of holding tokens by increasing value of the network and
								economic incentives from profits of projects funded by the DAO.</p>

							<p>Engagement: Shareholders are incentivized to get involved in creative pursuits and
								supporting the promotion of the multiverse.</p>

							<h3 class="red" id="dao-proposal">DAO Proposal for New Universe/World/Reality</h3>


							<p>Following our same model, a team of creatives decide to drop a new project, whether NFTs
								or not, and want to be part of the multi-verse. Perhaps some dialogue within the Gyris
								universe alludes to some “before place of the
								Rockmonsters”, and a community member conceptualises that world. By proposing their
								design thesis, and go-to-market strategy, the DAO can decide whether to seed this idea
								and accept the proposal from the founding team for support. It
								is
								up the proposing team to demonstrate why their fork belongs within the multiverse and
								how it is connected in some way. It must also demonstrate its commitment to the ideals
								of collaborative creativity and governance. Though each new
								project doesn’t need a DAO, a plan to display how they will integrate community into
								creativity is a crucial part of a Universe Proposal.</p>



							<h3 class="red">$GYRIS Token implications</h3>


							<p>The $GYRIS token total circulating supply cap is increased 9,227,465 per Universe or
								DAO-approved project.</p>
