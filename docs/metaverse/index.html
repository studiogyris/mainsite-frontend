					<h2 id="gyris-metaverse">What is the Gyris Metaverse?</h2>


					<p>The Gyris Metaverse is an open world built on Immutable X.  Our Genesis holders are our Pioneers; builders in a wild frontier. The Gyris Metaverse will result through the interaction of story and community. In the beginning of all great civilisations, the people did not own the land, they discovered it. All Gyris holders will have the opportunity to stake claim and settle in Gyris. There will be no initial land sale for Genesis holders as you are our frontier settlers. The Gyris Game will drop those willing, into our vast world.</p>


					<p class="text-center quote-in-text">“The world building of Age of Empires, massive multiplayer experience of World of Warcraft, and the social dynamics of Fable’</p>


					<p>Think of building your plot, then your village, then your town….you get the picture. The difference here is, just as in real life, you can’t do such things alone. You will be required to form guilds, tribes and communities to get the most out of the Gyris Metaverse. Some builds would be best served by a combination of classes and skills and for some builds the requirements are so hefty that NFT staking will be required in order to complete them.</p> 

					<p>But perhaps you don’t want to work for your goods and builds. Perhaps you fancy yourself a thief. Be warned that though this may be a quick way to earn benefit your actions will be recorded on the ledger and your reputation visible to all those who interact with you or are close to those who have. The good and the bad have consequences.</p>


					<h2 id="peoples-races-and-creatures">Peoples, Races and Creatures of Gyris</h2>


					<p>Gyris is coloured as richly as Earth with variation and difference. The Genesis drop will reveal four Genus of Gyris, the Peoples of the Bura, the Minjierri, Dharwar and the Mara. These will be the playable characters in the Gyris Metaverse. Initially your avatars will have limited ability to interact with the world with variability across Genus and class. The speed at which you can travel between locations will be dependent on your avatar’s Genus. Whilst the Mara can move fast, they do not possess the ability to lift large things like the Bura or move considerable amounts of earth in a timely fashion like the Minjierri. The Dharwar work more proficiently with stone and the Bura with wood. The earliest game prototype will allow your avatar to move around the available parts of Gyris, choose your patch of Earth, and from the world around you craft that which you need to survive. Trees will become wood, stone into bricks and blocks. Some food will give you energy, others help you see the unseen. You will have the ability to terraform, protecting your place from a future you fear lurks on the horizon. You can choose to work together with others or simply live out life on your own. In the beginning you will be safe from death….but not forever, for even Eden fell to original sin and soon enough The Dark will come.</p>

					<h2 id="game-economy">Game Economy</h2>


					<p>In the Gyris game this will not only come in the form of ‘play-to-earn’ mechanics but uniquely through a ‘create-to-earn’ philosophy. The $GYRIS token can be used to purchase in game items assets though this is not a pay-to-win game. The $GYRIS token will also be used to negotiate deals in-game with other community members when a item or sweat trade is not preferable.</p>  


					<p>The game’s development will benefit greatly from existing and future assets designed for our on-screen work including landscape elements. Working together with the Gyris Metaverse and Gaming Division and the Creative Team, community artists will be engaged to display their art and depiction of Gyris in the ecosystem marketplace. If selected as ‘Official Gyris Game Assets’, the artist will take the lion’s share of the $GYRIS paid for its use in game. This serves the project and the artist. Non-artists can still contribute. Terraforming parts of Gyris will be tough and utilising the materials around you, you will be free to build your own patch in the metaverse. Any quality game is a multi-year project but it’s important to understand that the assets we are building for the on-screen elements of Gyris, will be utilised by the Gyris Metaverse and Gaming Division and therefore budget for the game is reduced comparative to other projects that would try to deliver our level. We are here for the long haul.</p>


					<h2 id="rewarding-early-adopters">Rewarding early adopters</h2>

					<p>Settlers waves are dictated by the mint number of the Genesis Drop with our earliest holders rewarded first. All Genesis holders will have first access to new items, updates and news. Crucially, the pioneer settlers will not pay for any land they claim.</p>


					<h3 class="red">Environments</h3>


					<p>Our environments are taken directly from the stories of Gyris and map periodically released.</p>


					<p>Buralands:  Inspired by North Western Australia and Papua New Guinean geography we find dense forest, high mountains, deep cuts and valleys. Thunderous rivers but also endless branches of creek forks cutting lines in the mountainside. Families carve, paths into the earthen clay and form walkways from their hut to the waterways to wash and bath and fish. </p>


					<h3 class="red">The Underground</h3>



					<p>Home of the Minjierri these long winding mine shafts and cuts into Gyris’ crust will be turned into vast cities and labyrinths.</p> 



					<h3 class="red">The Coast</h3>



					<p>What will become the city of Porth is the Eastern Coast of Gyris. It provided for by fertile land to the South and West and Mountains to the North that provide easy access to stone for building.</p>


					<h3 class="red">The Kingdom of Wings</h3>



					<p>The Mysterious home of the Mara. These beings live in homes made of Earth or Trees in a land that must remain hidden in reference to the other areas on the map. It lies deep within a forest.</p>
