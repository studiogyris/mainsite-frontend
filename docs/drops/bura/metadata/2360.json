  "description": "The Bura are a large human-like Genus with considerable racial diversity as indicated by skin and hair colour. The Bura live largely remote and cut off from the rest of Gyris on the high elevation plateaus collectively known as 'The Buralands'. Atop these highlands you find dense forest, high mountains, deep cuts and valleys. Thunderous rivers but also endless branches of creek forks cutting lines in the mountainside. Families carve, paths into the earthen clay and form walkways from their hut to the waterways to wash and bath and fish. To each Bura, their fated Dua, a weapon to fight The Darkness that grows in the very forests that feed them.",

As a constant reminder of the Bura\u2019s fragility, he remembers all to well the poisoned Ogg that inflicted his wounds that night. It was this time in his life when he realised his true calling - a healer. \n\nWith a magical calmness about him, he is able to sense bura\u2019s pain and quickly became one of the only tribesmen with a true healing spirit. His constant thirst for information has taken him throughout the lands making significant discoveries in local medicines, healing techniques &  crafting of surgical tools. \n\nIt is whispered amongst his people that Naigati was \u201cBorn with the spirit of a Dua\u201d\n"
